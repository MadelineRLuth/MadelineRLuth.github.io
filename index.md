## About Me

My name is Madeline and I am a [Biomedical Sciences](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) graduate student in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD. Check out my Google Scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZwSmvToAAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of publications and other scholarly work. ![profile](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/50251155?s=460&v=4) 

## My Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms in malaria through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis [(IVIEWGA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*. 

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. [Coursework from BGGN213: Foundation of Bioinformatics](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/bggn213)
