# My GitHub Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms in malaria parasites through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis ([IVIEWGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#)). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*.

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. Copy Number Variant Detection Pipeline (Coming Soon!)

## Graduate Education and Research

### UCSD BMS Program and Graduate-Level Research
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Graduate Program](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego and am completing my dissertation in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/). Our primary research focus in the Winzeler Lab is identifying and developing chemotherapeutics and chemoprevention strategies for malaria, but we also develop and collaborate on projects exploring other infectious diseases and cancer.

#### My Current Research Areas and Interests in the Winzeler Lab
* Drug discovery and development in parasites and other pathogens
* Using experimental evolution to model drug resistance acquisition
* Analysis of large-scale omics datasets to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance
* High-throughput phenotypic screening

#### The Winzeler Lab in the News
As part of the press release for [our 2018 *Science* paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/eaat9446.abstract), the local San Diego news network ABC10 [ran a feature on our work](https://www.10news.com/news/san-diego-students-helping-to-lead-quest-to-end-malaria) conducting chemical screens against the liver stage of the malaria parasite and affiliated follow-up studies.

#### The Malaria Drug Accelerator (MalDA) Consortium
[MalDA](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/malda/) is an innovative target-guided discovery platform and collaboration between academic, non-profit, and pharmaceutical groups funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and centered at UCSD. I manage all sequencing and whole genome analysis for the consortium and participate in the Target Identification and Validation Focus Group. Below is our MalDA group photo which was taken at our annual all-member Palm Springs meeting at Omni Rancho Las Palmas in 2019.

#### Social Media Management
I run the Twitter handles for both the [Winzeler Lab](https://twitter.com/WinzelerLabUCSD) and [MalDA](https://twitter.com/MalariaTargetID).

#### Funding
My graduate work is partially supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research Award from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences ([T32 GM008666](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/T32-GM008666-16)) as a fellow in the [UCSD Genetics Training Program](http://genetics.ucsd.edu).

#### Teaching Experience
In Winter 2018, I was a Teaching Assistant for [Deborah Yelon](https://www-biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/dyelon)'s section of BICD100, an introduction to genetics. I lead 2 weekly discussion sections focused heavily on problem-solving, managed grading, and organized review sessions for midterm and final exams.

#### Extracurricular Involvement at UCSD
* Student Organizer for the 2018-2019 [Genetics, Bioinformatics, & Systems Biology Colloquium](http://genomic.weebly.com)
* Admissions Committee Member for 2018-2019 BMS Program Recruitment
* Student Organizer of the 2019 [BMS Program Annual Retreat](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/calendar/bms-retreat.html), featuring keynote speaker [Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io) from CalTech
* Student Organizer of the 2018-2019 BMS Student-Invited Speaker Seminar, featuring [Clodagh O'Shea](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/clodagh-oshea/) from Salk Institute

## Undergraduate Education and Research
I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology from UC Riverside in 2016. As an undergraduate research assistant in the lab of [David Crowley](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/crowley), I studied how properties of biochar influence survival and propagation of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and potential applications to agriculture. Following this work, I joined the lab of [Sharon L. Walker](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/W/walker-sharon/), where I investigated the attachment and detachment kinetics of *E. coli O157:H7* on leafy green vegetables, commonly a source of foodborne illness. In 2015, I was awarded the $5,000 [UCR Chancellor's Research Fellowship](https://se.ucr.edu/research/chancellor_fellowship) to complete my [University Honors](https://honors.ucr.edu) thesis titled "Effect of Material Properties on Bacterial Attachment to Thin Film Photocatalytic Titanium Dioxide" under the mentorship of Dr. Walker.

## Scientific Outreach and Volunteerism
