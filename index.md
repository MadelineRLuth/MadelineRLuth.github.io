## About Me

My name is Madeline and I am currently a [Biomedical Sciences](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) PhD student in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. I am also a member of the [Malaria Drug Accelerator (MalDA) Consortium](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/malda/), where my chief role is to process sequencing data from drug-resistant parasites. On the side, I manage the Twitter handles for both the [Winzeler Lab](https://twitter.com/WinzelerLabUCSD) group and [MalDA](https://twitter.com/MalariaTargetID).

**My main research interests include drug discovery and development in infectious diseases; analysis of large-scale omics datasets; and understanding genomic determinants of drug resistance.**

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology from UC Riverside, where I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the labs of David Crowley and Sharon L. Walker.

## My GitHub Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms in malaria through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis [(IVIEWGA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*. 

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. [Coursework from BGGN213: Foundation of Bioinformatics](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/bggn213)
