# My GitHub Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and resistance mechanisms in malaria parasites through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis ([IVIEWGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#)). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*.

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. Copy Number Variant Detection Pipeline (Coming Soon!)

## Graduate Education and Research

### UCSD BMS Program and Graduate-Level Research
I graduated with a Ph.D. from the [Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Graduate Program](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego in July 2022, completing my dissertation in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/). My primary research focus in the Winzeler Lab was the identification of chemotherapeutics and chemoprevention strategies for malaria, but I also developed and collaborated on projects exploring other infectious diseases and cancer.

#### Research Areas and Expertise
* Drug discovery and development in parasites and other pathogens
* Using experimental evolution to model drug resistance acquisition
* Analysis of large-scale omics datasets to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance
* High-throughput phenotypic screening

#### The Malaria Drug Accelerator (MalDA) Consortium
[MalDA](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/malda/) is a target-guided discovery platform and collaboration between academic, non-profit, and pharmaceutical groups funded by the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org), centered right here at UCSD. I manage all sequencing and whole genome analysis for the consortium and participate in the Target Identification and Validation Focus Group.

#### Funding
My graduate work was partially supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research Award from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences ([T32 GM008666](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/T32-GM008666-16)) as a fellow in the [UCSD Genetics Training Program](http://genetics.ucsd.edu).

#### Teaching Experience
In Winter 2018, I was a Teaching Assistant for [Deborah Yelon](https://www-biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/dyelon)'s section of BICD100, an introduction to genetics. I lead 2 weekly discussion sections focused heavily on problem-solving, managed grading, and organized review sessions for midterm and final exams.

#### Extracurricular Involvement at UCSD
* Student Organizer for the 2018-2019 [Genetics, Bioinformatics, & Systems Biology Colloquium](http://genomic.weebly.com)
* Admissions Committee Member for 2018-2019 BMS Program Recruitment
* Student Organizer of the 2019 [BMS Program Annual Retreat](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/calendar/bms-retreat.html), featuring keynote speaker [Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io) from CalTech
* Student Organizer of the 2018-2019 BMS Student-Invited Speaker Seminar, featuring [Clodagh O'Shea](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/clodagh-oshea/) from Salk Institute
* Student Organizer for the [2021 UCSD Genetics Program Retreat](https://genetics.ucsd.edu/annual-retreat/retreat-2021.html)

## Undergraduate Education and Research
I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology from UC Riverside in 2016. As an undergraduate research assistant in the lab of [David Crowley](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/crowley), I studied how properties of biochar influence survival and propagation of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and potential applications to agriculture. Following this work, I joined the lab of [Sharon L. Walker](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/W/walker-sharon/), where I investigated the attachment and detachment kinetics of *E. coli O157:H7* on leafy green vegetables, commonly a source of foodborne illness. In 2015, I was awarded the $5,000 [UCR Chancellor's Research Fellowship](https://se.ucr.edu/research/chancellor_fellowship) to complete my [University Honors](https://honors.ucr.edu) thesis titled "Effect of Material Properties on Bacterial Attachment to Thin Film Photocatalytic Titanium Dioxide" under the mentorship of Dr. Walker.

## Scientific Outreach and Volunteerism
* Graduate Application Mentorship Program (GradAMP) Mentor for the Fall 2020 application cycle
* Judge at the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 [Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair (GSDSEF)](https://www.gsdsef.org)
* eMentor for Del Lago Academy career advising program for high school students (2017-2020)
* Moderator for the 2019 UCSD Summer Research Conference for Undergraduates
* Member of UCR [Delta Sify](http://deltasify.weebly.com) (Change in Scientific Importance for Youth) Club (2014-2016)

## Consulting Experience
In Fall 2020, I joined the San Diego Chapter of [Seed Consulting Group](https://seedcg.org) as a consultant. Seed is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that provides pro-bono consulting to influential organizations pioneering a healthier and more environmentally sustainable California. In Spring 2021, I participated in a second project cycle as a Project Manager with a team of 5 consultants. In Winter 2021, I accepted a position on the San Diego Chapter Leadership Team as a Co-VP of Strategy & Operations, where I develop high-level organizational strategy and support project cycle operations.
