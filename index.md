## About Me

My name is Madeline Luth and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Graduate Program](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. I am completing my thesis work in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/) and as a member of the [Malaria Drug Accelerator (MalDA) Consortium](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/malda/). My chief research roles are to process sequencing data from drug-resistant parasites and develop models of drug resistance generation, and on the side, I manage the Twitter handles for both the [Winzeler Lab](https://twitter.com/WinzelerLabUCSD) and [MalDA](https://twitter.com/MalariaTargetID). My graduate work is partially supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research Award from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences ([T32 GM008666](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/T32-GM008666-16)) as a fellow in the [UCSD Genetics Training Program](http://genetics.ucsd.edu).

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology from UC Riverside, where I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the labs of [David Crowley](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/crowley) and [Sharon L. Walker](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/W/walker-sharon/). In 2015, I was awarded the $5,000 [UCR Chancellor's Research Fellowship](https://se.ucr.edu/research/chancellor_fellowship) to complete my [University Honors](https://honors.ucr.edu) thesis titled "Effect of Material Properties on Bacterial Attachment to Thin Film Photocatalytic Titanium Dioxide."

## Key Research Areas
* Drug discovery and development in parasites and other pathogens
* Analysis of large-scale omics datasets to understand the mechanisms of drug resistance
* High-throughput phenotypic screening

## My GitHub Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms in malaria parasites through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis ([IVIEWGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#)). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*. 

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. [Coursework from BGGN213: Foundation of Bioinformatics](https://madelinerluth.github.io/bggn213/)

## In the News
As part of the press release for [our 2018 *Science* paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/eaat9446.abstract), the local San Diego news network ABC10 [ran a feature on our work](https://www.10news.com/news/san-diego-students-helping-to-lead-quest-to-end-malaria) conducting chemical screens against the liver stage of the malaria parasite and affiliated follow-up studies.
