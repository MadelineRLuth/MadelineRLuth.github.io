## About Me

My name is Madeline and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego completing my thesis work in the lab of [Elizabeth Winzeler](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/). As a member of the [Malaria Drug Accelerator (MalDA) Consortium](https://winzeler.ucsd.edu/malda/), my chief roles in the lab are to process sequencing data from drug-resistant parasites and develop models of drug resistance generation. On the side, I manage the Twitter handles for both the [Winzeler Lab](https://twitter.com/WinzelerLabUCSD) and [MalDA](https://twitter.com/MalariaTargetID).

My graduate work is partially supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research Award from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences ([T32 GM008666](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/T32-GM008666-16)) as a member of the [UCSD Genetics Training Program](http://genetics.ucsd.edu).

**My main research interests include drug discovery and development in parasites and other infectious diseases; analysis of large-scale omics datasets; and understanding the genomic determinants of drug resistance.**

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology from UC Riverside, where I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the labs of David Crowley and Sharon L. Walker.

## My GitHub Repositories
Most of my work involves identifying drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms in malaria parasites through the process of *in vitro* evolution and whole genome analysis ([IVIEWGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451780#)). Doing so requires building bioinformatics pipelines to analyze genomic data at scale. The following repositories represent my work in pipeline development and their applications in *P. falciparum* (the malaria parasite) as well as side projects in *S. cerevisiae* and *T. gondii*. 

1. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/p_falciparum_analyses)

2. [Whole Genome Analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/yeast_analyses)

3. Whole Genome Analysis of *Toxoplasma gondii* (Coming Soon!)

4. [Omics Pipe and General WGS Pipeline Framework](https://github.com/MadelineRLuth/Omics_Pipe)

5. [Coursework from BGGN213: Foundation of Bioinformatics](https://madelinerluth.github.io/bggn213/)
